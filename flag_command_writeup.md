# flag command
I'm using pwnbox which is a cloud-based virtual machine environment on HTB.
Flag Command is a simple web challenge on HTB, where you are presented with four questions and options. By guessing correctly or finding a hidden command, you can uncover the flag

After trying to beat the game manually :), I finally gave up.
I decided to view the page source and came across three interesting JavaScript files that seemed important. I looked through command.js and game.js files but I didnt find anything significant there.

I viewed the main.js file and found a function named CheckMessage() that sends the user command to the /api/monitor endpoint via a POST request.

By using the the browsers dev tools. I can intercept network traffic and look for the /api/monitor endpoint.

After viewing the response from the api endpoint we see something interesting. We have our four questions with their respetive options, and we also have a secret.

Going back to the main.js file, we see that the function also checks if the command is in availableOptions['secret'], and if it is, it bypasses everything and gives you the flag

Rabbit holes I went down:
- trying to brute-force through all of the options using a python script.
- Messing around with the requests in burpsuite.

Sorry if this writeup isn't very detailedâ€”I'm new to web challenges and still experimenting on HTB. I'm learning as I go, and I hope this walkthrough can still provide some useful insights!
